Bachelor in Statistics from the University of Costa Rica (UCR), with graduation scheduled for February 2025. Currently, I perform research roles in two academic institutions: Junior Researcher at the [Anker Research Institute](https://www.ankerresearchinstitute.org/) and Research Assistant at the [Institute of Social Research](https://iis.ucr.ac.cr/) of the UCR. My research interests include inequality and poverty studies, wage studies, applied multivariate statistics for the social sciences, and data science.
